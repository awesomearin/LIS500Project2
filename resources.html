            <h3>Intersectionality</h3>
            <p>Here are some resources for defining and identifying amounts of intersectionality.</p>

            <p>In this video, Ruha Benjamin covers how technology can be both a blessing and a curse as we progress our technologies while leaving our inclusivity and intersectionality behind.</p>

            <p>Here, Danielle Wood talks about space innovations that can help take care of the human population if used properly. She works to tear down the barriers that bind many different groups
            of people in order to unify them under the common goal of space exploration.</p>
            <p>Intersectionality is a tool for analyzing how different factors of prejudice and social structures such as class, race, and gender, play into the viewpoints of different groups of people.
            This article helps to show why intersectionality matters in maintaining a healthy workspace and a clean social environment overall.</p>

            <h3>Implicit Bias</h3>
            <p>Here are resources that can help measure your own implicit bias. Implicit bias is defined as a negative attitude, of which one is not consciously aware, against a specific social group.</p>
            <p>The Harvard Implicit Bias Tests contains a comprehensive list of surveys that help measure your own implicit bias. When we took the tests, we were often surprised by how quickly we were 
            tripped up by the tests' many curveballs. The link is below.</p>
